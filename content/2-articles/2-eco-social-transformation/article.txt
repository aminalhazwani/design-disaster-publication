**a. The Great Transformation**

(img: est_icon_01_01.png)

>The historical process of western societies shows a sucsessive disembedding of the economic sector out of its social and natural context and a successive incorporation of society and nature in the economic system and the logic of capital.

**b. Downscaling: The only path to a sustainable future**

1. Reduction of ressource consumption (on the level of enterprizes, public area and individual life)
↓
2. Re-use of material (gradle to gradle)
↓
3. More efficient use of ressources ( 80% of energy gets lost)
↓
4. Keeping the carrying capacity and ressource basis for future life.

**c. Threefolding: The Transformative Power of Civil Society**

The surprizing phenomenon of the 21. century is the raising power of civil society (CS) as corrective, complement and alternative to shoreless worldmarket and powerless political systems. (Nicanor Perlas)

CS represents social-cultural values versus those of capital.
