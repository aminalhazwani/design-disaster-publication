Title: Designing blackouts

Description: This paper has been developed in singular circumstances, which deserves to be told. Answering to the kind invitation of Alvise Mattozzi and Kris Krois, I gave a talk that suggested that rather to avoid disasters, design might be helpful to implement blackouts. Following the “enlightened catastrophism” of the philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy, I proposed that the best way to think about the electricity grid and its required new design is to organise blackouts, namely periods during which electricity is not available for people on a given territory.

Intro: 

This paper has been developed in singular cir45cumstances, which deserves to b75e told. Answering to the kind invitation of Alvise Mattozzi and Kris Krois, I gave a talk that suggested that rather to avoid disasters, design might be helpful to (link: http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackout text: implement blackouts). Following the “enlightened catastrophism” of the philosopher Jean-Pierre Dupuy, I proposed that the best way to think about the electricity grid and its required new design is to organise blackouts, namely periods during which electricity is not available for people on a given territory. This proposition is not made to be provocative, but to position the grid issue in ontological terms. What is the nature of the electricity obviousness? What is the organisation behind the fact that we have the assurance to get the possibility to use electricity at any time in many increasing places? What is required from all beings constituting the grid and its usages? How have these usages expended so that electricity is intrinsically associated to human development? I start with the assumption that “Design thinking” can contribute to new images and plans since the questions concern sociotechnical systems in which users are central but often neglected.

When I gave my talk, I did not imagine that one year later, the government of the country in which I live (Belgium) would announce a plan to unload the grid from whole parts of the territory.
Due to the unexpected closure of three nuclear power plants, Belgium might lack electricity next Winter at peak hours, when electricity is mostly needed to light buildings and roads, to heat many places, to run trains, to cook, to perform economic activities, etc. This nuclear shutdown (3 gigawatts) represents around one quarter of the peak consumption (13 GW). Since Belgium was already on the provision edge, and since electricity exportation is limited (3,5 GW) and not reliable (the bordering countries might also need their electricity at peak hours), federal authorities have developed an emergency plan that would cut power for defined parts of the grid. vThe government and Elia, the Belgian Transmission System Operator (which manages the high voltage part of the network), have decided to preserve cities, industries and security facilities (hospitals, police, firefighting) to the detriment of less densely populated and industrialised areas. At the same time, on the 3rd November 2014, authorities have issued a communication plan that will try to marshal all users — households, enterprises, industries and administrations — and align them on the same goal: reduction of the electricity consumption at peak hours. Although authorities look confident that users, whether affected or not by the possibility of a power cut, will prove their solidarity in acting at their levels, nobody knows what will happen.

The electricity grid is probably the biggest machine ever built. At a national level, the grid connects billions of appliances, lamps and other machines. The grid is a machine of machines, which balances production and consumption at all time. The balancing process, controlled with the frequency stabilisation, creates an actual solidarity between billions of machines. This solidarity is weak, in the sense that it is mostly one-way (at the exception of big industries), and that environment is not really part of the landscape. Consumption leads production: in switching the light on, I (almost) immediately require that electricity is produced on the grid. Fortunately, there is some inertia in the grid for it enables to react and pilot the super machine. **Reactions are not instantaneous but only very fast**. And consumption can have some flexibility (automated in most industries that use high amounts of power). Grids are built with a certain capacity corresponding to a maximum power. Therefore utilities endeavour to limit peak demands and to shift loads at off-peak hours. On another hand, renewable production increases, utilities are searching also ways to shift demand to peak productions. Grids are now flooded with currents that runs in all directions. New electrical solidarities are tied between entities, including decentralised production, wind turbines and solar panels.

### Long term energy objective
Long term energy objective can only be 100% renewable. To get a slight chance to avoid climatic disasters, all energy consumption should be renewable by 2100 (IPPC 2014), with a large share for developed countries by 2050. We have therefore time to learn how to adapt activities, but this learning should begin immediately and rapidly. We have to go from societies based on a stock of energy (fossils) to organisations structured by variable energy fluxes. This can be realised according to priorities:

1. reduce energy demand
2. use efficient means to deliver energy, 
3. produce and adapt demand to available resources.

As progresses in storage are slower than development of energy capture (PV, wind, biomass), it is crucial to *learn how to reduce electricity consumption* when production is limited and increase consumption when there is an excess of production. This logic of offer reverses the perspective of the presentday grid that is mainly governed by demand. As production are decentralised and new active entities added to the grid, its topology must evolve.

> This evolution of the grid is often presented as “smart”. 

The idea of a smart grid result from the superimposition of, on one hand [^1], information and communication technologies and, on the other hand electricity grids. Many technological promises are made and new actors emerge. However, nobody knows how smart grids will be shaped. Different scenarios are possible. Many pilots are conducted all over the world. Different actors strive to translate their interests into materialised devices (e.g. smart meters, electrical vehicles). Smart grids are usually presented to solve many problems in the energy sector.

They can help reduce transmission and distribution losses, optimize the use of existing infrastructure by helping to regulate power flows and meet peak demand, accommodate significant volumes of decentralized and renewable energy into the grid, improve energy efficiency by managing the consumption patterns of new and existing users connected to the grid, and even develop a “self-healing” grid. Incumbent actors and policy makers believe that smart grids are essential for achieving energy security, affordable energy and climate change mitigation. In summary, the grid is the place where multiple technological, economic and political interests cross.
